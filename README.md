# Personal-Website
My own personal website

It's still is in development, and I'm experimenting a lot. 
But you can find the webpage About Me in the HTML folder and the About Me folder. In there you'll find the Index.html file.
The idea behind this part is to explain who I am, where do I come from, my experience and my passions. It basically is a CV
online.

The other parts are not quite finished but are improving. I want to include a portfolio, a blog, a travel, and a book recommendation pages to the website.
You can find them for now in the HTML folder.
